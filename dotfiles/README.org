* Made this rep following recommendation from distrotube "easier way to manage dot files"
1. There is a magic line in .zshrc that alias config to adding git 'stuff' to a bare directory
2. We can then use config add <dotfile>
   Ex. $ config add .zshrc
3. Then do a config add -m "message"
4. Finally do a config push -u origin master
